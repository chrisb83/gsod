**Improving the documentation of scipy.stats**

The aim of the project is to enhace the documentation of the statistics module of SciPy (scipy.stats). The current documentation contains a reference guide that describes the API of the functions and a tutorial (see *Related material* below for the links). The existing material can be extended in terms of content and quality. 

Some ideas that a technical writer can work on:

* improve the tutorial site of the stats module
    * review and suggest changes to improve the existing material
    * describe further use cases 
* improve the documentation of the reference guide 
    * check whether current description can be improved, also taking into account known issues
    * add examples and references
    * cross-reference to other relevant / similar functions in the module

The second point would require good knowledge of statistics whereas the first point should only require basic knowledge. In general, the project leaves a lot of freedom to the technical writer depending on interest and background. The mentors would assist and provide guidance as needed.
